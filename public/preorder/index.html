        <strong>Hello everyone! Lewy here, your humble author.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing this book is a labor of love for me, and it takes a huge chunk of my time. I’m using my savings to fund my writing, and they are fading fast. This means I'm not able to spend as much time writing as I would like. If you're finding the book useful and thinking to yourself that you might buy it when it comes out, I'd like to ask you to consider preordering it now. Your preorder will help me to work on the book full time and finish it much faster. Not to mention, you'll have my eternal gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full book will be available in 2021. <a href="/#mailing-list-signup">Sign up for the mailing list</a> and follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/lewy_blue/">Twitter</a> for updates. In the meantime, if you have any feedback, or just want to say hi, <a href="/contact/lewy_blue">get in touch!</a> I'd love to hear from you.
