# Welcome to Our Community: three.js Around the Web

If there's one thing that sets three.js apart from the competition more than anything else, it's the amazing community that will help and support you while you learn to use the library. No matter what your issue is, whether you need help with a thorny 3D math problem, are trying to understand some difficult syntax, have an idea for a new feature, want feedback on your work, or think that you've found a bug, you can usually get a response in a matter of hours. Provided you ask in the right place, that is.

Here are some places around the web where you'll find the three.js folk hanging out.

## The Official three.js Forum

The best place to ask for help, showcase your project, or engage in general three.js chitchat, is the [official three.js forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/), which has been around since April 2017. It's highly active and you'll find lots of enthusiastic people there who will be happy to help you out.

Projects posted in the [showcase category](https://discourse.threejs.org/c/showcase/) may be selected for display on [the three.js homepage](https://threejs.org/), which is updated a couple of times a year to display the best new projects from around the web.

## Discord

The [official three.js Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/jYMz4sX) is a great place to get to know the people who create beautiful things using three.js. It's also a great place to showcase your work or ask for help in a less formal setting than the forum.

## three.js on StackOverflow

{{< figure src="app-logos/stackoverflow.png" alt="StackOverflow logo" lightbox="false" class="tiny left noborder" >}}

Before the forum arrived, StackOverflow was the best place to ask three.js related questions, and [you'll still find lots of useful information there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js?sort=votes). The fastest way to get help with three.js is to post on _both_ the forum and StackOverflow. However, if you do this, please crosslink your posts so the kind people who help you don't duplicate their work.

## three.js on GitHub

{{< figure src="app-logos/github.png" alt="GitHub logo" lightbox="false" class="tiny left noborder" >}}

The [three.js GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) is a hive of activity, and if you do report a bug there, it will often be fixed in a matter of hours. However, **the repo is not a help site** and if you go there asking for help you will politely be asked to use the forum instead.

If you need to file a bug report, please [read these guidelines](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/new) first.

## Twitter

Twitter is a great place to find professional developers showcasing their three.js projects.

Here's a couple of hashtags to search for: [#threejs](https://twitter.com/search?q=threejs), [#webgl](https://twitter.com/search?q=webgl), [#creativecoding](https://twitter.com/search?q=creativecoding), and here are some accounts to follow: [@threejs](https://twitter.com/threejs), [@mrdoob](https://twitter.com/mrdoob) (the creator of three.js), [@lewy_blue](https://twitter.com/lewy_blue) (your occasionally humble author).

## Slack

{{< figure src="app-logos/slack.png" alt="Slack logo" lightbox="false" class="tiny left noborder" >}}

Slack, the bane of businesses everywhere. And of course, [you'll find three.js there too](https://threejs.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzYxMzczODM2OTgxLTQ1YmY4YTQxOTFjNDAzYmQ4NjU2YzRhNzliY2RiNDEyYjU2MjhhODgyYWQ5Y2MyZTU3MWNkOGVmOGRhOTQzYTk#/).

## Facebook

{{< figure src="app-logos/facebook.png" alt="Facebook logo" lightbox="false" class="tiny left noborder" >}}

On Facebook, it's all about the pages. Here's a couple to get you started:

- [WebGL](https://www.facebook.com/groups/webgl/)
- [three.js](https://www.facebook.com/groups/threejs)
- [Procedural / Generative Art](https://www.facebook.com/groups/procgenart/)

## The three.js Subreddit

{{< figure src="app-logos/reddit.png" alt="reddit logo" lightbox="false" class="tiny left noborder" >}}

You can also try your luck with the [three.js subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs), but beware of falling into the black hole of Reddit and having your life sucked away into a dreary existence of memes and trolling! In any case, it tends to be less active than the forum or discord.

## Watch Out for Outdated Answers!

three.js has a rapid development cycle. When you are searching through old forum posts, especially on StackOverflow, beware of out of date information. Older answers are still useful, but the solutions might have to be adapted to work with recent versions of three.js. Keep an eye out for any warnings logged to the browser console to let you know you are using outdated syntax.
